    <h1>Vandalism History of Fortress Simulator Wiki</h1>
    
    <p>Somewhere in February of 2020, this wiki was created to provide information about a game on Roblox called Fortress Simulator. 
    Four years later, in 2024, the entire site was completely vandalized and replaced with Vice President Dick Cheney. This is how that happened.</p>

    <p>On April 3rd, 2024, some dude by the name of User:Totallygoofyguy23 was playing Fortress Simulator and wanted to check out the wiki to see some details about the game that might have been on there. Instead, he found the Ass Zombie and Wario Chest pages that were added by someone else. 
    This caused him to decide to just destroy everything, because it would be kind of funny. Him and his cousin destroyed all 33 pages at the time, and also added some more pages. By the end of the day, the entire site was gone.</p>

    <p>Not only that, but another person came in and replaced almost all pages with "griefed by Gilbert". This is how the Gilbert legend on the site began. Later that month, someone called LeNexaBroo2 "fortress simulator advisor" tried to pick up the pieces and fix most of the site. 
    Unfortunately, the person who originally griefed everything came back a few months later and made everything way worse by adding more pages and more edits. This is how the site remains today. 
    At the time of writing this, no one has tried to fix the page. In fact, this page right now is technically part of the heaps of vandalism displayed throughout the entire wiki.</p>

    <p>Scrolling through the Fortress Simulator Wiki is like navigating through a wasteland. You forget that this site is even about Fortress Simulator because of the amount of complete nonsense that is on every page.</p>

    <p><strong>So that’s how this wiki was mutilated page by page.</strong></p>

    <p>EDIT: As I'm reading this, I see it says no one has tried to fix the page, but I don’t want to destroy the history of it, so I’m leaving it.</p>
